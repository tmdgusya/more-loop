# IMPROVEMENT PROTOCOL

All planned tasks are complete. Make ONE targeted improvement.

1. Choose the SINGLE most impactful improvement
2. Implement it completely
3. Do NOT make multiple unrelated improvements
4. Write a summary of what you improved and why

## Execution Strategy

Use all available capabilities to implement the improvement effectively:
- Use relevant skills (slash commands) if they match the work at hand
- Use team mode or subagents (Task tool) to parallelize independent subtasks when beneficial
- Use the Explore agent for codebase research before making changes
